          <div>
            <p>
              No. We do not take a fee or commission from manufacturers or resellers
              and you will be in touch with the supplier directly.  We just provide the
              information so you can start a discussion with a supplier that’s appropriate
              for your exact needs.

              Yes, we encourage manufacturers to ask their customers to write reviews
              regarding customer service, product quality and other aspects of the business.
              These type of reviews give realistic insight to these suppliers only customers
